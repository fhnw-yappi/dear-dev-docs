However, the limited attention paid to the appropriate use of theories to underpin the research in this area leaves it unclear how to deal with human aspects of software engineers, such as motivation and satisfaction. Objectives: This article aims to expose what drives the motivation and satisfaction of software engineers at work. Methods: A multiple case study was conducted at four software organisations in Brazil. For 11 months, data was collected using semi-structured interviews, diary studies, and document analyses. Results: The Theory of Motivation and Satisfaction of Software Engineers ({TMS}-{SE}), presented in this article, combines elements from well established theories with new findings, and translates them into the software engineering context. Conclusion: The {TMS}-{SE} advances the understanding of people management in the software engineering field and presents a strong conceptual framework for future investigations in this area.},

	abstract = {The growing literature on affect among software developers mostly reports on the linkage between happiness, software quality, and developer productivity. Understanding happiness and unhappiness in all its components -- positive and negative emotions and moods -- is an attractive and important endeavor. Scholars in industrial and organizational psychology have suggested that understanding happiness and unhappiness could lead to cost-effective ways of enhancing working conditions, job performance, and to limiting the occurrence of psychological disorders. Our comprehension of the consequences of (un)happiness among developers is still too shallow, being mainly expressed in terms of development productivity and software quality. In this paper, we study what happens when developers are happy and unhappy while developing software. Qualitative data analysis of responses given by 317 questionnaire participants identified 42 consequences of unhappiness and 32 of happiness. We found consequences of happiness and unhappiness that are beneficial and detrimental for developers' mental well-being, the software development process, and the produced artifacts. Our classification scheme, available as open data enables new happiness research opportunities of cause-effect type, and it can act as a guideline for practitioners for identifying damaging effects of unhappiness and for fostering happiness on the job.},

	abstract = {Given the relevance of coordination in the field of global software engineering, this work was carried out to further understand coordination mechanisms. Specifically, we investigated meetings and the collaboration tool Slack. We conducted a longitudinal case study using a mixed-methods approach with surveys, observations, interviews, and chat logs. Our quantitative results show that employees in global projects spend 7 h 45 min per week on average in scheduled meetings and 8 h 54 min in unscheduled meetings. Furthermore, distributed teams were significantly larger than co-located teams, and people working in distributed teams spent somewhat more time in meetings per day. We found that low availability of key people, absence of organizational support for unscheduled meetings and unbalanced activity from team members in meetings and on Slack were barriers for effective coordination across sites. The positive aspects of using collaboration tools in distributed teams were increased team awareness and informal communication and reduced the need for e-mail. Our study emphasizes the importance of reflecting on how global software engineering teams use meetings and collaboration tools to coordinate. We provide practical advice for conducting better meetings and give suggestions for more efficient use of collaboration tools in global projects.},

Concretely, answering these questions will help to optimize development processes and select tools that increase job satisfaction and productivity. Our work adds to a large body of research on how software developers spend their time. We report the results from 5971 responses of professional developers at Microsoft, who reflected about what made their workdays good and typical, and self-reported about how they spent their time on various activities at work. We developed conceptual frameworks to help define and characterize developer workdays from two new perspectives: good and typical. Our analysis confirms some findings in previous work, including the fact that developers actually spend little time on development and developers' aversion for meetings and interruptions. It also discovered new findings, such as that only 1.7\% of survey responses mentioned emails as a reason for a bad workday, and that meetings and interruptions are only unproductive during development phases; during phases of planning, specification and release, they are common and constructive. One key finding is the importance of agency, developers' control over their workday and whether it goes as planned or is disrupted by external factors. We present actionable recommendations for researchers and managers to prioritize process and tool improvements that make good workdays typical. For instance, in light of our finding on the importance of agency, we recommend that, where possible, managers empower developers to choose their tools and tasks.},

	shorttitle = {The influence of sleep on job satisfaction},
	abstract = {Introduction
This study draws on the conservation of resources theory to investigate whether the loss of sleep can trigger the loss of additional resources that are necessary for work.

Methods
Using cross-sectional design of 322 call center employees working at a government-owned public bank in South Korea, we test the study hypotheses using regression and bootstrapping indirect effects analyses.

Results
The results of analyses show that insufficient sleep increases employee burnout and that psychological capital mediates this relationship. We also find that insufficient sleep decreases job satisfaction via a serial mediation model such that insufficient sleep reduces psychological capital, which in turn increases burnout, and ultimately results in lower job satisfaction.

Discussion
The findings reinforce the previous assessment that although sleep is a non-work factor, its impact spills over to the workplace. Theoretically, this study goes beyond direct effect to uncover the underlying or mediating mechanisms that account for the impact of the sleep-burnout relationship and the sleep-job satisfaction relationship. For managers, the results highlight the significance of sleep to employees’ overall health and well-being and thus underscore the need to foster a work culture that recognizes and prioritizes employee sleep needs.},

	shorttitle = {Job strain and resting heart rate},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Numerous studies have reported an association between stressing work conditions and cardiovascular disease. However, more evidence is needed, and the etiological mechanisms are unknown. Elevated resting heart rate has emerged as a possible risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the relation to work-related stress. This study therefore investigated the association between job strain, job control, and job demands and resting heart rate.
{METHODS}: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected men and women in Västra Götalandsregionen, Sweden (West county of Sweden) (n = 1552). Information about job strain, job demands, job control, heart rate and covariates was collected during the period 2001-2004 as part of the {INTERGENE}/{ADONIX} research project. Six different linear regression models were used with adjustments for gender, age, {BMI}, smoking, education, and physical activity in the fully adjusted model. Job strain was operationalized as the log-transformed ratio of job demands over job control in the statistical analyses.
{RESULTS}: No associations were seen between resting heart rate and job demands. Job strain was associated with elevated resting heart rate in the unadjusted model (linear regression coefficient 1.26, 95 \% {CI} 0.14 to 2.38), but not in any of the extended models. Low job control was associated with elevated resting heart rate after adjustments for gender, age, {BMI}, and smoking (linear regression coefficient -0.18, 95 \% {CI} -0.30 to -0.02). However, there were no significant associations in the fully adjusted model.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Low job control and job strain, but not job demands, were associated with elevated resting heart rate. However, the observed associations were modest and may be explained by confounding effects.},

	abstract = {Work stress has been associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Two major pathways capable to explain the link between job stress and the cardiovascular diseases have been extensively studied: the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous system ({ANS}). The analysis of heart rate variability ({HRV}) has been proposed to assess the regulation of the {ANS}. Several studies established that {HRV} reduction is a strong and independent predictor of mortality in patients with various cardiovascular diseases. However the assessment of {HRV} can also be used as a non-invasive tool to predict cardiovascular events in healthy subjects. The aim of this paper is to review and report the results of main studies assessing the association between {JS} and {HRV}. Up to now a limited number of studies assessing the relationship between working conditions and {HRV} has been published. In the majority of them, higher levels of {JS} has been found associated with lower values of {HRV}. The literature suggests that {HRV} analysis can be a valid indicator of {JS} effects on the cardiovascular system. For the future studies are necessary longitudinal cohorts studies appropriately selected, to obtain information about the cardiovascular effects of prolonged {JS}.},

The relationship between physical activity and the specific domain of job satisfaction is, however, relatively unknown. This study aims to investigate the effects of different frequency levels of {LTPA} on self-reported job satisfaction and specifically focuses on the two mechanisms of health and recovery from work stress.
{METHODS}: Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2001-2019), fixed effects and dynamic panel data regression models are estimated to address the problems of unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. A mediation and sub-sample analysis shed light on the role of health and work stress.
{RESULTS}: The results reveal that weekly {LTPA} has a positive effect on job satisfaction and that health represents a channel yielding those benefits. The effect appears to be moderated by work stress. Further, the analysis reveals the importance of considering unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality when studying this relationship.
{CONCLUSION}: The findings indicate a positive relationship between regular {LTPA} and job satisfaction and add plausible causal evidence to the limited literature in this context. The findings yield implications for employers and employees.},
